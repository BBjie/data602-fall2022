# DATA602 Repository
Welcome to DATA/MSML602 - Introduction to Data Science! This is our course repository for all programming related assignments and materials.

Over the course of the semester, you will work with a variety of software packages, including Python Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and others. Installing those packages and getting started can often be a hassle because of software dependencies, so we instead provide the assignments as *Google CoLab notebooks*.

For those unfamiliar with GitHub, below is some basic information about the platform.

### Google CoLab and Notebook Basics

The programming assignments will distributed to be run using *Google CoLab*. These environments give you access to all the computational resources needed to complete the programs without having to install any dependencies / packages to your local machines.

Most importantly, the Colab notebooks can be *directly cloned to your Google drive account* for you to complete the assignments.

Please visit the "Preliminaries" folder for a basic introduction and examples of Google CoLab notebooks. We expect you to write your assignments in Colab Notebooks and submit the corresponding .ipynb files to elms for grading.
