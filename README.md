# Project 0: Computing Environment

Over the course of the semester, you will work with a variety of software packages, including Python Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and others. Installing those packages and getting started can often be a hassle because of software dependencies, so we instead provide the assignments as *Google CoLab notebooks*.

---

### Google CoLab

The programming assignments will distributed to be run using *Google CoLab*. These environments give you access to all the computational resources needed to complete the programs without having to install any dependencies / packages to your local machines.

Most importantly, the Colab notebooks can be *directly cloned to your Google drive account* for you to complete the assignments.

We have provided a notebook titled Assignment_0.ipynb to familiarize you with the compute environment and how to edit / execute your code within these notebooks.


### Notebooks from Python for Exploratory Computing, Mark Bakker, Delft University of Technology

These are some of the notebooks from the above course - more details can be found at http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/. 

We have copied there over here so that you can start playing with them quickly. In order for the links below to work, you must have started the Jupyter Server using Docker above.
